# Mirror Mirror - Automated Reverse Shell Generation Tool

### Overview

**Mirror Mirror** is an automated reverse shell generation tool designed for Windows x64 environments. It dynamically generates reverse shell payloads with customizable settings, allowing penetration testers and red teams to deploy effective reverse shells. The payloads can be generated in a variety of formats including Python, C, C#, and PowerShell, ensuring compatibility across multiple environments and use cases.

The payloads produced by Mirror Mirror are intended for **ethical penetration testing and research purposes only**, and should be used with explicit permission from the system owner.

### Features

- Generate reverse shell payloads for Windows x64 systems.
- Supported output languages: **Python**, **C**, **C#**, and **PowerShell**.
- Customizable IP address, port, shell type (`cmd` or PowerShell), and variable names.
- Ability to save generated shellcode to a binary file.
- Dynamically create shellcode that avoids null bytes and certain restricted characters.

### Prerequisites

To use **Mirror Mirror**, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [Keystone Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) (For assembling shellcode)
- A Windows x64 machine (for running the generated payloads)

To install Keystone, use the following command:

```sh
pip install keystone-engine
```

### Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mirrormirror.git
cd mirrormirror
```

Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Mirror Mirror is a command-line tool that allows you to generate shellcode dynamically. Below is a brief overview of how to use it:

```sh
python mirrormirror.py --ip <listening IP> --port <listening port> --language <output language> --variable <variable name> --type <cmd or powershell> --save <True/False> --output <output file>
```

#### Example

To generate a reverse shell payload in Python with IP `192.168.1.10` and port `4444`, run the following command:

```sh
python mirrormirror.py --ip 192.168.1.10 --port 4444 --language python --variable buf --type cmd --save True --output payload.bin
```

This command generates a Python-compatible reverse shell and saves the shellcode in a binary file named `payload.bin`.

### Arguments

- `--ip` / `-i` : Listening IP address (required).
- `--port` / `-p` : Listening port (default is `443`).
- `--language` / `-l` : The programming language for the output shellcode (options: **python**, **c**, **csharp**, **powershell**; default is `python`).
- `--variable` / `-v` : The variable name for shellcode array (default is `buf`).
- `--type` / `-t` : Shell type (`cmd` or `powershell`, default is `cmd`).
- `--save` / `-s` : Whether to save the generated shellcode to a binary file (`True`/`False`).
- `--output` / `-o` : The desired file path to save the shellcode.
